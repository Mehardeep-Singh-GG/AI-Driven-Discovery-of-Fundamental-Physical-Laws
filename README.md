# AI-Driven-Discovery-of-Fundamental-Physical-Laws
a self-learning model, constrained solely by fundamental physical principles, autonomously derived core physical laws.  the AI system reconstructed known physical equations. This work establishes a new paradigm in physics research, demonstrating the power of AI  in unveiling deep physical structures beyond human intuition.
